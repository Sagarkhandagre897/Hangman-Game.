Hangman is a word game in which one player has to guess a word that the other player (the computer in this case) has thought of, by guessing the letters in it. Every time the player guesses a wrong letter, the rope that's tightening the man will get pulled by a tiny bit, until it gets completely pulled and the man is hanged. The player has to make the right guesses before the rope gets completely pulled to win the game.
